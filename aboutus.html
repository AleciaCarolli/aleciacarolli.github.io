  <p>Carolli’s Cupcakes has been ruining diets since 1999. Alecia Carolli in Toronto founded our cupcake shop, 17 years ago!
  The shop has been encouraging batter-covered fingers, icing sugar messes and the delicious taste of fresh baked treats ever 
  since. Carolli’s Cupcakes uses only the finest ingredients to create handcrafted cupcakes, such as pure vanilla, fresh 
  berries and mouth-watering chocolate. Our frosting is incomparable and will melt in your mouth. Nothing taste better than
  buttercream…well…maybe our chocolate frosting! Come in and try our cupcakes today! “After years of culinary school, I 
  decided it was only time to open up my own bakery. I contemplated what baked goods I wanted to produce, and realized 
  that you can never go wrong with a cupcake. Why buy one cake, when you can buy multiple different flavors of cupcakes?
  All I know is that since I was little, the cupcake has been the clear winner of baked goods. If you don’t believe me come 
  into my shop and I can prove you otherwise!” –Alecia Carolli, The owner
